# Cobalt

Cobalt is lightweight and powerful framework for your web apps. Inspired by AngularJS we want to create faster and simple framework for everyone.

Cobalt does not support all browser including old IE versions. Instead of this we want to create *a framework which use latest standards*.

## Main ideas

 - Decoupling DOM manipulation from business logic improves simplicity and testability
 - Development should be as simple as possible. Simple way to create new functionality saves your time
 - No 3rd-party libraries. Only native APIs
 - Performance matters

## Features

## Browser support

This list will be updated later
